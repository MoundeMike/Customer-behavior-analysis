Data Analytics Project: End-to-End Business Insights
Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from raw data to actionable insights. It covers data loading, exploration, cleaning, SQL analysis, and visualization through an interactive dashboard. The goal is to showcase practical data analytics skills using industry-standard tools

Dataset
The dataset contains structured business data used for analysis and reporting
It was loaded into Python for preprocessing and later stored and queried using a PostgreSQL database
Data quality issues such as missing values and inconsistencies were addressed during the cleaning stage

Tools & Technologies
Python – Data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn – Data manipulation and visualization
PostgreSQL – Data storage and SQL querying
SQL – Aggregations, joins, and analytical queries
Power BI – Interactive dashboard and data visualization
Gamma – Presentation (PPT) creation
Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

Project Steps
Data Loading:
  Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  Analyzed data structure, distributions, and trends
  Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
Data Cleaning:
  Handled missing values and duplicates
  Standardized column names and data types
Database & SQL Analysis:
  Loaded cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database
  Ran SQL queries to extract insights, perform aggregations, and support reporting
Visualization & Dashboard:
  Connected Power BI to the PostgreSQL database
  Built an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics and trends
Reporting & Presentation:
  Summarized insights in a clear analytical report
  Created a professional presentation using Gamma

Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard highlights:
  Key performance indicators (KPIs)
  Trends and patterns over time
  Category and segment comparisons
  Data-driven insights for decision-making

Results & Insights
Identified key trends and performance drivers in the data
Highlighted areas of growth, risk, and opportunity
Delivered insights in a clear, visual, and business-focused format

How to Run the Project
Clone this repository
Install required Python libraries:
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn psycopg2
  Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts for data loading, EDA, and cleaning
  Set up a PostgreSQL database and import the cleaned dataset
  Execute the provided SQL queries for analysis
